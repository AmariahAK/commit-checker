# Placeholder WAV file
# This would be a real WAV audio file in production
# For now, this serves as a placeholder to show the sound system structure

# Sound files would be stored here:
# - commit.wav (commit notification sound)
# - level-up.wav (level up celebration sound)  
# - achievement.wav (achievement unlock sound)
# - error.wav (error notification sound)

# To implement:
# 1. Use pydub to play audio files
# 2. Support multiple formats: .wav, .mp3, .ogg
# 3. Volume control in config
# 4. Platform-specific audio backends
